Open Banking has become the latest buzzword in FinTech, it's set to revolutionise the financial industry but what is it and how does it work? This article covers all the basics and gives you some insights on how to use it.

Open Banking is a secure way to give providers access to your financial information. It all began when the European Parliament adopted the revised [Payment Service Directive (PSD2)](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_19_5555) which aims at promoting innovation, competition and efficiency in payment services. This also triggered the UK to issue a ruling that required the nine-biggest UK banks to allow providers access to their data and many other banks followed suit.
