Open Banking has become the latest buzz word in the FinTech sector, everyone is talking about it and the prediction is that will revolutionise the financial industry but what is it and how does it work? This article covers all the basics and gives some insights on how to use it. 

# The basics 

As described on [the website](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/customers/what-is-open-banking/) that promotes it, Open Banking is a secure way to give providers access to you financial information. The initiative began in 2015 at the European Parliament through the [Revised Payment Services Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Services_Directive) (aka PSD2) aiming at increasing the competition by extending the participation on the payment industry to non-banks. This triggered the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in the UK to issue a ruling that required the nine-biggest UK banks to allow licensed startups direct access to their data.
