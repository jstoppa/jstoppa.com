Open Banking has become the latest buzz word in the FinTech sector, everyone is talking about it and the prediction is that will revolutionise the financial industry but what is it and how does it work? This article covers all the basics and gives some insights on how to use it. 

# The basics 

As described on [the website](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/customers/what-is-open-banking/) that promotes it, Open Banking is a secure way to give providers access to you financial information. The initiative began in 2015 at the European Parliament through the [Revised Payment Services Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Services_Directive) (aka PSD2) aiming at increasing the competition by extending the participation on the payment industry to non-banks. This triggered the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in the UK to set up an Open Banking Implementation Entity (OBIE) to deliver Open Banking, their initial objective was to issue a ruling that required the nine-biggest UK banks to allow licensed startups direct access to their data, this also appears to have caused the UK challenger banks to jump on the bandwagon and embrace the initiative by implementing APIs for Open Banking.

Open Banking takes the same approach as OpenID took a decade or so ago when most of the major tech companies joined the initiative, this supports the ability to login to a service with another identity provider without having to create a new account. In practical terms, when trying to sign in into a website such as [Medium](https://medium.com/m/signin), you get the ability to create an account or rather use any other service such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, etc 

This is also how Open Banking works, you can sign in into a website or mobile app by authenticating to your bank provider where you need to type your bank account login details. In the same way as in OpenID, the website will have access to your personal details but also to other information such as bank account's transactions, this is more sensitive data to share than your email, home address and telephone number, regulating the access is crucial amd that's what I'm covering in the next section
