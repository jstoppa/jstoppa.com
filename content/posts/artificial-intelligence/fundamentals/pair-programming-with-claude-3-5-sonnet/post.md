It's not new that Anthropic has always been ahead of its competitors when it comes to producing better results for helping users and developers create working solutions. With the release of its latest Claude 3.5 Sonnet, the company has clearly stepped way ahead of its competitors. In this article, I'm demonstrating it with an example of how I did pair programming.

# Starting with the basic?

For those who haven't used it before, [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) offers their flagship model [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/). This tool is similar to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), but its capabilities have proven more successful in helping developers build solutions. This sets it apart from services like [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) or [Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/), which I personally view as AI-powered alternatives to search engines like Google (https://www.google.com/).

# How to use it?

Navigate to the [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/), login and start asking question, a good example is to use one of the predefined example, for instance the convert the UI design to front-end code.

and simply with that, you can see the code result an even the preview which shows you the app running from the code in the browser itself!

worth noting that this is a new functionality just released by Anthropic called [Artifacts](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9487310-what-are-artifacts-and-how-do-i-use-them), you can activate the functionality following the step I show in the graph below.
