It's not new that Anthropic has been always ahead of its competitors when it comes to producing better results for helping users and developers to produce working solutions, with the release of its latest Claude 3.5 Sonnet, the company has clearly step way ahead of they competitor and I demonstrating this with an example on how I did pair programming with it.   

# Starting with the basic?

For those who haven't used it before, Anthropic offer their flagship model [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/), their service looks very similar to  [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and seems to be focusing on a service orientated to development and buillding things unlike other services like [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) or [Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/) which I personally find to be services that are looking to compete with  (Google)[https://www.google.com/] with heavy use of AI.

# How to use it?

Navigate to the [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/), login and start asking question, a good example is to use one of the predefined example, for instance the convert the UI design to front-end code.

and simply with that, you can see the code result an even the preview which shows you the app running from the code in the browser itself!

worth noting that in order to activate this functionality, you first need to setup an artifact.
